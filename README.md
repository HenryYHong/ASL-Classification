# ASL Classification - Real-time American Sign Language Recognition

This project aims to develop a computer vision program for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures in real time. Using a machine learning model trained on an MNIST-style dataset with ASL data, the program interprets hand signs and classifies them into corresponding ASL letters or words.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Efficient image preprocessing pipeline to normalize and prepare gesture images.
- **Model Architecture**: Leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture spatial features unique to each hand gesture.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Processes live video feed for real-time ASL recognition.
- **User Interface**: Interactive interface to display recognized ASL letters in real-time.

## Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras

## Usage
Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the script to start the ASL recognition program on your local machine.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for full words and phrases
- Addition of more ASL gestures
- Optimization for mobile platforms
